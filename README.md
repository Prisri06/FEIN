# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is FEIN?
FEIN (Fluid Evaluation and Inspection Network) is a project that aims to create a portable multiparameter water quality meter at a fraction of industry standard costs. The device will test for temperature, conductivity, TDS, ORP, pH, and free cholorine.

## Why is it useful
Water quality monitoring is crucial to public health, environmental regulation, and industrial processes - it is needed to maintain the quality of drinking water, detect changes in aquatic ecosystems, prevent corrosion in industrial systems, etc. 

## Proposed/implemented parameters
  TDS (Total Dissolved Solids): measures concentration of dissolved salts, minerals, and organic matter, in terms of parts per million
  ORP (Oxidation Reduction Potential): measures the strength of oxidizing and reducing agents in the water, in terms of voltage, with positive values corresponding to higher levels of oxidizing agents
  Conductivity: measures how well the water conducts electricity, in terms of siemens per unit distance. This value is used to determined total dissolved solids
  pH: measures acidity of water
  Free Chlorine: measures concentration of chlorine available to sanitize contaminants


## What are our future goals for the project?
We intend to update the device with all planned sensors, as well as potentially implementing a built in display.
